 * <b>Keyple Client Async Node</b> API.
 * <p>
 * This kind of node should be bind on the client's side if you want to use a full duplex
 * communication protocol, such as Web Sockets for example.
 * <p>
 * Then, you should provide an implementation of the {@link KeypleClientAsync} interface in order to
 * interact with this node.
 * <p>
 * Keyple provides its own implementations of this interface and manages their lifecycle.<br>
 * This kind of node can be bind to a all <b>client</b> Remote SE plugins and services :
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code NativeSeClientService}</li>
 * <li>{@code RemoteSeClientPlugin}</li>
 * <li>{@code RemoteSePoolClientPlugin}</li>
 * </ul>
 * To create it, you should only bind an <b>async</b> node during the initialization process.<br>
 * Then, you can access it everywhere on the client's side using one of the following utility
 * methods, depending on your use case :
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code NativeSeClientUtils.getAsyncNode()}</li>
 * <li>{@code RemoteSeClientUtils.getAsyncNode()}</li>
 * <li>{@code RemoteSePoolClientUtils.getAsyncNode()}</li>
 * </ul>
